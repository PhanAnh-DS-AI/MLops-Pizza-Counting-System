# üçï Pizza Detection & Counting System

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end system for detecting, tracking, and counting pizzas in CCTV-like videos. It features a FastAPI backend for processing and a Streamlit frontend for user interaction, all orchestrated with Docker Compose. The system enables object detection, multi-object tracking (SORT), region-based pizza counting, and user feedback submission for future improvements.

---

## üéØ Target

**Objective:**  
Build a system to count the total number of pizzas sold over a given period using the provided CCTV videos. The system should:

- Detect pizzas from videos using a computer vision model.
- Track pizzas across frames to avoid duplicate counting.
- Count pizzas accurately using a defined counting region.
- Collect user feedback for future model improvement.
- Be deployable via Docker Compose.

Although the system is not required to include model retraining, it should be designed in a way that future improvement via feedback is possible.

## üìä Pipeline Overview

![Pipeline Diagram](img_video_demo/pipeline.png)

The main components of the pipeline include:

- **YOLOv8** for real-time pizza and person detection.
- **DeepSORT (via sort-tracker-py)** for multi-object tracking.
- **Custom polygon regions** to trigger pizza counting logic.
- **FastAPI backend** for processing and feedback.
- **Streamlit frontend** for user interaction.
- **Docker Compose** for unified deployment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (recommended)
- Or: Python >= 3.12 and pip (for manual/local run)

---

## üõ† Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd MLops_Pizza-Detection
```

### 2. Build and run with Docker Compose

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up --build
```

- **Backend (FastAPI):** http://localhost:8000  
- **Frontend (Streamlit):** http://localhost:8501

### 3. Manual run (optional)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# In terminal 1
uvicorn src.api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# In terminal 2
streamlit run src/streamlit/client.py --server.port=8501
```

---

## How to Use

1. Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
2. Upload or choose a video to process
3. Click **Start Live Detection** to begin detection & tracking
4. Click **Stop Processing** to end session and download the results (CSV, video)
5. Submit optional feedback to improve future versions

## üì° API Endpoints Summary

- `POST /process` ‚Äî Start processing a video
- `GET /stream/{video_name}` ‚Äî Live stream of processed video
- `POST /stop/{video_id}` ‚Äî Stop processing
- `GET /results/{video_id}` ‚Äî Get counting results (CSV)
- `GET /video/{video_id}` ‚Äî Download final processed video

---

## üí¨ Feedback Collection & Retraining

After viewing a processed video, users can submit structured feedback from the frontend.  
This feedback is saved in `.json` format and will be useful for future model refinement or retraining.

---

## üê≥ Docker-Orchestrated Pipeline

- FastAPI and Streamlit run in **separate containers**
- Both services share data using **Docker volumes**
- Easy-to-use, portable MLOps pipeline for video analytics

---

## Conclusion

The final system successfully:

- Detects pizzas using **YOLOv8**.
- Tracks them using **DeepSORT**.
- Counts them based on movement through custom **polygon regions**.
- Displays results and allows feedback via a web interface.

Although the system occasionally miscounts pizzas due to detection errors or camera angles, it meets the core goal of the project ‚Äî automating the counting of pizzas sold using CCTV footage.

## üôè Acknowledgment

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **EATLAB** for giving me the opportunity to complete this technical assignment.

## Personal Reflection

Through this challenge, I had the opportunity to combine my foundational knowledge of object detection with real-world coding experience. More importantly, I learned many new things during the implementation ‚Äî from building an MLOps pipeline, integrating object tracking via DeepSORT, to solving practical issues in logic-based pizza counting.

This assignment encouraged me to be resourceful, to learn quickly, and to overcome problems one by one ‚Äî from camera-frame mismatches, ID switching in tracking, to designing a modular architecture. Despite time limitations, I chose to include retraining and feedback components in the pipeline diagram to demonstrate a vision of continuous improvement.

This has been a valuable and rewarding experience for me. I enjoy learning through solving real problems and always seek the most effective solution ‚Äî even when it means trying unfamiliar tools or approaches. I truly appreciate this opportunity.

This was also my first time building a project with an MLOps perspective. Although I have not yet implemented full retraining or fine-tuning from user feedback, I took the initiative to self-study the fundamentals of MLOps pipelines and reflect that understanding in the project structure ‚Äî even if some parts remain incomplete.

Once again, I sincerely thank the company for providing such a real-world problem to work on. It was both challenging and inspiring, giving me the chance to grow through research, self-learning, implementation, and iteration.
